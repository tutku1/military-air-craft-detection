# military-air-craft-detection

This project utilizes artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to identify military aircraft by analyzing satellite photos. Primarily, it leverages a pre-trained model such as VGG16, which processes images in layers to recognize specific objects. TensorFlow and Keras libraries are used for implementation.

Object Detection Process:
1. Data Collection: Photos of military aircraft are gathered for the project.
2. Model Training: These photos are used to train the deep learning model. The model learns to recognize aircraft from various angles and environments.
3. Object Recognition: The trained model can identify and classify aircraft in new satellite photos. During this process, the model detects characteristic features of aircraft, such as wing shapes.

Such detection capabilities are critical in defense and security domains.
